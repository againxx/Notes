# Relocations

## Types
* `R_X86_64_PLT32` direct program linker to add a PLT entry for that symbol, often occurs in `.o` files
    - The 32 in the name of the reloc refers to the size of the reference, which is 32 bits
* `R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT` / `R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT` When the program linker creates an entry in the PLT or the GOT, it must also generate a dynamic reloc to tell the dynamic linker about the entry
